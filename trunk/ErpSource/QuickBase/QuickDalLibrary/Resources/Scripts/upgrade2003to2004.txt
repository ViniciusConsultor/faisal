-- Author:		Faisal
-- Create date: 23-Nov-2008
-- Description:	This trigger updates the ItemSummary table for stock, total purchased, total sold etc.
-- Modification Hisotry
-- Date			Updated By		Details
---------------------------------
-- 24-Jan-2009	Faisal		Table name is changed from Inv_Stock to Inv_ItemSummary so the trigger
--												is changed accordingly. Summary_Type field will now hold the different
--												summary types, such as "Stock", "Purchased", "Sold". Trigger is also
--												changed from trigUpdateStock to trigUpdateItemSummaryStock. Because
--												this trigger will only hold code for stock.
-- 07-Feb-2009	Faisal		Deleted was being checked when record is inserted. It is corrected now.
