-- =============================================
-- Author:		Faisal
-- Create date: 23-Nov-2008
-- Description:	This trigger updates the ItemSummary table for stock, total purchased, total sold etc.
-- =============================================
-- ------------ Modification History -----------
-- Author	Date		Details
-- ------   ----        -------
-- Faisal	24-Jan-2009	Table name is changed from Inv_Stock to Inv_ItemSummary so the trigger
--						is changed accordingly. Summary_Type field will now hold the different
--						summary types, such as "Stock", "Purchased", "Sold". Trigger is also
--						changed from trigUpdateStock to trigUpdateItemSummaryStock. Because
--						this trigger will only hold code for stock.
-- Faisal	07-Feb-2009	Deleted was being checked when record is inserted. It is corrected now.
-- Faisal	01-Mar-2009	Added Comment header.
--						This trigger was inserting and updating always regardless of document type.
-- Faisal	16-May-2009 Incorporated warehouse_id in inventory tables.
-- Faisal	28-Jun-2010	Incase of record status 4 (deleted) factor set to 0 so that it does not
--						affect stock.
